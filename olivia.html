    <div class="bio">
      <p> Hello! My name is Olivia Heng and I am a 15 year old Korean-Cambodian-American. I am the second eldest of six children and one of our favorite pastimes is going to Six Flags Great Adventure! One of my dreams consists of going to every Six Flags in the United States and hopefully the ones international too! In the fall, I will be a sophomore at Ocean City High School in Ocean City, New Jersey where I am a member of Student Council, Leadership Club and Key Club. I enjoy giving back to my community, being involved in extracurriculars and hanging out with my best friends Arianna and Isabela!</p> </div>

<h3>Modern Technology</h3>

</div>
<article class="side">
      <p class="mainheadtext">  While there are many different opinions on whether or not technology has changed our world for the better or worse, it is undeniable that technology has improved our lives as a whole. Instead of going out to the grocery store to buy produce for the week, you can simply download a Postmates app and have it delivered to your front door! Or for example, if you do not own a car and have to travel from place to place, instead of saving up you can simply pay for an Uber or Lyft to take you to your desired location. Phones, computers, televisions and much more are being upgraded to make our lives easier. While many are concerned that this may lead to laziness and less interaction with others, these discoveries are one step further to figuring out the unimaginable. Technology has made modern medicine substantially better in recent years and many individuals have lived long healthy lives thanks to it. Education has also been a concern and schools all
      over the nation are investing in tablets and computers for their school. Children are now learning at a young age the importance of understanding technology and its opportunities like Kode With Klossy that gives teens an inside look on how it works. As technology continues to grow, we as humans must adapt to anything that may come our way and complete the impossible. </p>

        <h3> My Experiences </h3>
      </div>


<article class="side">

<p class="subheadtext1"> Though discrimination has gotten better over the years, it still is an issue when discussing females and Asians in certain fields. As a Asian-American female living in America, I have experienced many different types of discrimination both in school and in public areas. With the stereotype that all Asians are smart and I being a hardworking student, many dismiss my work and grades because of my ethnicity. No matter the struggle I go through to study or get help from teachers and classmates, it all is overlooked because I am Asian. I believe this is a terrible mindset because every individual has a different story and different personalities, so to stereotype a group together based on norms is wrong. In public, I was at Six Flags Great Adventure where I was standing in line for a ride with my sister and a group of boys started mocking Asian accents; feeling the need to come behind and ridicule us. This was a terrible experience that I hope no one has to go through, even though small acts of discrimination are common. Even in school, when I had signed up for AP Computer Science Principles for sophomore year, I was looked down upon because 1: female and 2: Asian. I hope to break this gender and ethnicity gap by spreading awareness and sharing my stories.</p>

      <h3>Find One's Identity</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="subheadtext1">Living in an age of social media and phones can be troublesome because the number of likes and followers can cloud one’s mind to be “perfect”. Today, society dictates what is popular or unpopular through cellular devices, like phones or tablets. If one does not have access to a device, they are disconnected from the world going on around them. Phones have become a need, not a want because many people, companies, and corporations are dependent on quick access to communication. Along with these devices, social media has widely changed our world today. Platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are used by millennials and teenagers to compare themselves to others, which studies have shown to be unhealthy. The number of likes, followers, and views are all seen as an online success, and individuals will take extreme measures to make them look “perfect.” However, countless views also mean countless types of people looking at the same photos and each having their own opinion on them. Public users are prone to getting terrible comments by haters hiding behind their screens, only emphasizing the flaws of each photo. This can be very damaging to one’s self-esteem and even famous online influencers, varying from Instagram stars to YouTubers, have been taking breaks from social media due to its way of damaging mental health. These experiences can change one’s identity for the worse because mental health has become one of the most significant issues as technology grows. Hate comments make users second guess the person they have made of themselves and will most times attempt to change who they are to feel accepted. One’s identity makes a single person unique, because no matter the similarities, no two people will be exactly alike. Various experiences can bring both positivity and negativity to their personality and the way one views life. An essential step to finding oneself is understanding that one is meant to be unique, not an exact image of others. Society claims being accepted has importance when, in reality, it all depends on one’s core values. By allowing one to focus on their inner selves, one’s mind will rid itself of negative beliefs of oneself which are generally the roots of anxiety. Self-worth is crucial to being able to find one’s identity for if one has a low sense of self-worth, then they will believe they are “defined by what they do or whom they believe they are [which] prevents them from appreciating their qualities and talents.” ( Thrive Global ). By having a high sense of worth, one will be able to value all they have become and live a life they have destined for themselves. Believing, understanding, and acting as one’s core identity will allow one to have better control over their actions and decisions throughout life.</p>
