    </div>

    <div class="bio">
      <p> My name is Inayah Ahmad and I'm 13 years old. I attend Noor-Ul-Iman private school in South Brunswick, NJ. I was born in America but my family is from Pakistan, which makes me a Pakistani-American. I love to eat different foods, but my favorites are sushi, ramen, and Chipotle. I love to draw and learn languages. I currently know English, some Arabic and Urdu, and I'm learning Korean. In the future I would also like to learn Japanese and Spanish.</p> </div>

      <h1> Living in the 21st Century</h1>
      </div>

      <p class="mainheadtext"> As a girl/woman in th 21st century, I feel there are many stereotypes about us. People, including other women, consciously and unconsciously make invalid judgements. This is something that should be avoided, because it can end up offending others.<br> For example, there is a stereotype that pink is girl color. This may offend girls who don't particularly like the color pink or even men who prefer the color pink. Although this is a stereotype that is slowly going away many people still think this unconsciously. I have witnessed this personally because I don't like the color pink. </p>

        <h3> My Experiences </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="subheadtext1">

      <p> Many of my experiences aren't extreme, however they still made an impact on my life. For example, I have had many small experiences while playing soccer. My soccer team is an all muslim team, so we all wear a scarf, long sleeves, and leggings underneath our shorts. Most of the other teams don't care about any of this, but some do. We have had unfair referees and coaches who curse us out. My coach always says to not care about what they say and to just give it 110%.These  things may have hurt, but se made sure it didn't dent our confidence. </p> </div>
