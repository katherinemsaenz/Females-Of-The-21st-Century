      <h3>  Bio </h3>

    </div>

    <div class="bio">
      <p> Hi! I am Katherine Michelle Saenz. I am 15 years old and my birthday is on August 28th. I come from a small town in Hudson County called Guttenberg and originally I live in Jersey. I go to a school named County Prep and I will be a junior this upcoming year. My parents immigrated from small country in Central America named El Salvador to the United States making me Salvadorian-American.I have two sisters and a brother. I am super interested in the science world and hope to get a career in the field. During my free time I like to travel, explore, interact with others, make art, and play sports such as softball and swimming.I like to learn new things and empower others. My passion in life is to make a mark in the world and show girls interested in science like me that anything is possible no matter who you are or where you come from.</p> </div>

<h3>Growing Up With Tech</h3>

</div>
      <p class="mainheadtext">  Technology has drastically changed since the times a computer could barely fit into a room. Today we live in a generation where technology has allowed such deviecs like a computer to fit in the palm of our hands. As a result younger and younger generations are able to explore the world and various opportunities through phones, tablets, computers and more. For example, growing up my older sister was not allowed to have a phone until she was fifteen. This was partly due to cultural differences as well as the limited accessibility to such high tech phones. It was not normal for teens let alone young kids to have their own phones in spanish culture as well as it was not that easy to afford such devices. My youngest sister actually has her own tablet now and is exposed to different technological devices that growing up I was not allowed to use that often. As time goes on things will naturally change and even though technology has definitely provided multiple drawbacks it has opened up the world to more opportunities and has made the 21st century a unique time period with life changing experiences. </p>

        <h3> My Experiences </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="subheadtext1">

      <p> Throughout my life I have gone through many different events which have helped shape who I am today. As I previously mentioned in my bio I come from parents who are both hispanic. Growing up I was always told that because I was female and I was interested in science I did not have to try so hard and that maybe science was not really my passion. I knew that certain individuals believed I would not fufill my own expectations. During middle school I realized how much I actually loved science.Many of my teachers helped opened my eyes and made me realize there are so many different opportunities. When entering high school I became really interested in environmental science and currently I am majoring in it. I believed environmental science was one of the only sciences I could really like but I was wrong. Signing up for Kode with Klossy I had my doubts that I would not like coding and it would be to hard. However, I love it! I would have never thought that computer science could be so much fun. I truly find so much happiness in coding and I hope that as time goes by I do not lose interest and share my skills with other females and help open their eyes to a new world of science.  </p> </div>
